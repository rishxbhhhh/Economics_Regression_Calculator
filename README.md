Also calculates R^2 value, Sb, Se, and table value (a help towards university students)
1. What to input ?
A. -> set of values of dependant variable (usually termed 'y') separated by comma
   -> set of values of independant variable (usually termed 'x') separated by comma
   
2. What are the outputs ?
A. -> Sum of x values, sum of y values, sum of [x * y] values, sum of [x^2] values, sum of [y^2] values, R^2 value, Sum of error, table value and most importantly
the Regression Estimate Equation itself including the variables 'a' and 'b' if the form of Regression Estimate is- y' = a + (b*x) , where y' is the predicted output.
